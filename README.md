# Summary

Using Platypus -a framework for evolutionary computing- for multiobjective optimization in the context of travel problem.

# About Platypus

Platypus is a framework for evolutionary computing in Python with a focus on multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). It differs from existing optimization libraries, including PyGMO, Inspyred, DEAP, and Scipy, by providing optimization algorithms and analysis tools for multiobjective optimization.
